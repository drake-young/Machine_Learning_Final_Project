# Machine Learning Final Project

A comparative evaluation of the performance and overhead of both Locality-Sensitive Hahsing and Classification when used in a search-by-image application.

The specifics and results will be added as a later data, as the project is still in progress

<hr/>

## Completed:

* Locality-Sensitive Hashing functionality is fully operational with the full dataset in grayscale (~17,000 images that are 150x150 pixels and belong to one of 6 classes)
* Evaluation for the LSH search-by-image application

## To Do

* Implement the classification search by classifying query images, and evaluating only images within the determined class of the query. 
* Evaluate the performance of search-by-image via classification
* Create evaluation metrics which allow comparison of the two programs and visualize the differences
