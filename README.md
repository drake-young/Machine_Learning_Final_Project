# Machine Learning Final Project

A comparative evaluation of the performance and overhead of both Locality-Sensitive Hahsing and Classification when used in a search-by-image application.

There currently exist several notebooks, a grayscale and an RGB version for classification search, LSH search, and linear search implementations of a search-by-image applications. The notebooks are fully documented with markdown, and act as their own READMEs.
