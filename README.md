# Machine Learning Final Project

A comparative evaluation of the performance and overhead of both Locality-Sensitive Hahsing and Classification when used in a search-by-image application.

There currently exist two notebooks, a grayscale and an RGB version that perform the same functionality both with and without the color channels. The two notebooks are fully documented with markdown, and act as their own READMEs.

The classification search may be uploaded on a separate repository depending on decisionby the rest of the team.
